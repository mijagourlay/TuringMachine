# Makefile for tm
#
# Written and Copyright (C) 1997 by Michael J. Gourlay
#
# PROVIDED AS IS.  NO WARRENTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 0) Read the README file.  Then read this Makefile.
#
# 1) Make a backup copy of this Makefile.
#
# 2) Edit each of the variables before the "SRCS=" statement.
#
# 3) From the shell, type "make depend".
#    If this fails or if you don't have makedepend, just delete all of
#    the lines (if there are any) below the "depend:" rule near the
#    end of this Makefile.  Look for the rule that says "depend:" and
#    read the comments that follow it.
#
# 4) From the shell, type "make".
#
# 5) If there are any errors or compiler complaints, find out why and
#    fix them :).  Then send email to the author explaining the cause of
#    the problem, and its solution.  If it's a big deal, I'll put your
#    name in lights for the next release.  See the README file for
#    the author's internet email address.
#
#    But seriously folks, if you can't figure out the problem, send
#    the author email.  Before complaining, though, read the man
#    pages for your C compiler and your linker.  If you're using
#    static linking and you get a linker problem, try dynamic
#    libraries, and vice versa.
#
#
#    If all goes well, there will be an executable called "tm".

SHELL=/bin/sh


##
## C COMPILER
##
#
# You must use an ANSI C compiler.
#

#CC=ucbcc
#CC=apcc -DANSI
#CC=cc
CC=gcc -DANSI




##
## INCLUDE FLAGS:
##
# Set INCLUDE to refer to the place where your header files reside.
#
# Cygwin needs to include the ncurses path.
#
INCLUDE=
INCLUDE=-I/usr/include/ncurses


##
## DEBUG FLAGS
##
# -O usually means "optimize"
# -g usually means "debug"
#
# On most compilers, optimization and debugging flags are mutually
# exclusive.  A notable exception is the GNU C compiler, which can
# have both debugging and optimization.
#
# GNU C compiler supports -Wall for lots of warnings.
#
# SGI native compiler supports -fullwarn, so I use it for development
#
DEBUG=-O
DEBUG=-O -fullwarn
DEBUG=-g -O -Wall


##
## C COMPILER FLAGS
##
#
# Read the man page for your C compiler before sending me email about
# problems.
#
CFLAGS=$(DEBUG) $(INCLUDE) $(DREAL) -DSUNOS
CFLAGS=$(DEBUG) $(INCLUDE) $(DREAL) -DBUSY_BEAVER_SEARCH


##
## LIBRARIES
##
#
# Read the man page for your linker before sending me email about
# problems.
#
#
# Linux: Use ncurses instead of curses.
#
# Other machines: use curses
#
# SUNOS: Use the /usr/lib/debug/malloc.o module if you want to do
# -- memory checking.
# -- Also see the CFLAGS comments about memory checking under SUNOS.
#
LIBS = -lcurses /usr/lib/debug/malloc.o
LIBS = -lncurses
LIBS = -lcurses
