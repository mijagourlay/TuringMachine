Turing Machine simulator and visualizer</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tm &minus;m

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tm</b> is a
Turing Machine simulator and visualizer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tm</b> has
two display modes: visual and non-visual. In visual mode
<b>tm</b> generates a text curses display of the state
machine transition table, with the current state and input
entry highlighed. Also, the segment of the tape currently
being accessed by the tape head is displayed. In non-visual
mode, <b>tm</b> simply runs the turing machine, streaming
out status information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In visual mode,
the Turing Machine simulator has two execution modes: debug
and free-run. In debug mode, the machine will step one
instruction each time the user presses a key. In free-run
mode, the machine executes without waiting for key presses,
but still rapidly displays the machine state and tape. It
also possible to toggle the visual updating while still in
&quot;visual mode&quot;, which yields considerable speed up
of the simulation, but with the ability to toggle back into
debug mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In visual mode,
some keyboard keys have special meaning, in both debug and
free-run modes: The &quot;Escape&quot; key halts the
machine. The &quot;d&quot; key toggles debug mode. This
means that you can go between debug and free-run when ever
you like. The &quot;v&quot; key toggles the visual updating.
When visual updating is turned off, the machine executes
much faster, but not as fast as when not in visual mode. The
&quot;?&quot; key displays a summary of these commands. In
debug mode, other keys simply step the machine forward one
instruction.</p>

to identify.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If both visual
and verbose options are active, then the initial printing of
the state transition table, and the initial printing of the
tape are suppressed since they would be immediately over
written by the visual display, and they both appear in the
visual display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If none of the
optional options (d,v,V) are activated, then <b>tm</b> does
not produce particularly interesting information. Perhaps
the most useful application of <b>tm</b> without any of the
d,v,V options is to see whether a particular Turing Machine
ever halts.</p>

<h2>BASIC CONCEPTS
<a name="BASIC CONCEPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Turing
Machine is a very basic computer model introduced by Alan
Turing in the 1930s. Turing called these machines
&quot;Logical Computing Machines&quot;. Such a machine
consists of an infinitely long tape, a tape head, a current
state, and a set of state transition rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape is
segmented into frames. Each frame can contain a single
character. The set of allowed characters is called the
<b>character set</b>. The tape frames are both readable and
writeable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape head
can move either left or right on the tape, and performs the
reading and writing of the tape.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The set of
state transition rules is a table which, given the current
state and the current input, provides an instruction in
three parts: What to write at the current tape frame, which
way to move the tape head, and what state to enter next.
This set of state transition rules is described in the
<i>machine_file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a cool
example of a Turing Machine in science fiction, read Neal
Stephenson&rsquo;s book, <b>The Diamond Age</b>.</p>

<h2>MACHINE FILE FORMAT
<a name="MACHINE FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>machine_file</i> format is a text file which is intended
to be human-readable. The file can contain blank lines and
comment lines as well as lines which provide information
about the state transition table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
non-comment line in the <i>machine_file</i> should be</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charset_max</b>
<i>integer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where the
integer is the maximum value of the character set for the
tape. The integer must be positive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the
<b>charset_max</b> line is encountered, the rest of the
<i>machine_file</i> consists of <b>&rsquo;state&rsquo;</b> /
<b>&rsquo;input&rsquo;</b> line blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
non-comment line in the <i>machine_file</i> should be</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>state</b>
<i>comment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which marks the
beginning of a set of rules for a given state. States are
numbered sequentially, starting at 0. The
<b>&rsquo;state&rsquo;</b> string can be followed by a
comment line. Each time a <b>&rsquo;state&rsquo;</b> line is
encountered, the total number of states in the machine is
incremented, and the following <b>&rsquo;input&rsquo;</b>
lines, up until the next <b>&rsquo;state&rsquo;</b> line,
are used to fill the state transition table for the current
state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Between
<b>&rsquo;state&rsquo;</b> lines are
<b>&rsquo;input&rsquo;</b> lines which have the form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>input</b>
<i>integer</i> <b>write</b> <i>integer</i> <b>move</b>
<i>L|R|S</i> <b>next</b> <i>integer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The integer
following the <b>&rsquo;input&rsquo;</b> string is the value
on the tape which will result in the execution of the rest
of this <b>input</b> line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The integer
following the <b>&rsquo;write&rsquo;</b> string is the value
written on the tape at the current frame.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both integer
arguments of <b>&rsquo;input&rsquo;</b> and
<b>&rsquo;write&rsquo;</b> must be within the character set
as defined by the <b>charset_max</b> line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The character
follwing the <b>&rsquo;move&rsquo;</b> string is either
&rsquo;L&rsquo; for left, &rsquo;R&rsquo; for right, or
&rsquo;S&rsquo; for stop, which indicates the direction the
tape head is to move. &rsquo;S&rsquo; indicates that the
machine should stop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The integer
following the <b>&rsquo;next&rsquo;</b> string indicates the
state to enter into next. The integer must refer to a valid
state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Turing
Machine starts in state 0.</p>

<h2>TAPE FILE FORMAT
<a name="TAPE FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>tape_file</i> is a text file which described the initial
value of the tape. The first line of the tape file must be a
comment line of the form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#</b>
<i>comment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second line
of the tape file must be an integer which is the starting
index of the rest of the values in the tape file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third and
subsequent lines in the tape file are tape frame values or a
line of the form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>state</b>
<i>integer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A line
beginning with the string &quot;state&quot; is used to
indicate the starting state of the machine. If no
&quot;state&quot; line is present, then state 0 is assumed
to be the starting state. Usually, the user will not supply
a starting state because the convention with Turing Machines
is that their initial state is the first state in the table.
The &quot;state&quot; ine feature is intended to be used
only for restarting a Turing Machine simulation from a
previous execution. Only one &quot;state&quot; line may be
present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The values of
the tape frames are interpretted as sequential from left to
right, starting at the index given on the second line of the
tape file. Tape values must be one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a tape value
is preceded by the string &quot;head&quot; then the
corresponding tape frame will be the starting location of
the tape head when the simulation starts. If the tape head
is not specified in this way (i.e., if there are no tape
values preceded by the &quot;head&quot; string) then the
initial head location will be at index 0. If more than one
&quot;head&quot; line is present in the tape file, an error
occurs.</p>

<h2>VISUAL MODE
<a name="VISUAL MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;visual&quot; mode displays the state transition table,
the segment of the tape in the vicinity of the tape head,
and some other information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The left-most
column of the state transition table indicates the state.
Each row of the state transition table indicates the
instructions to perform for that given state. Each of the
columns to the right of the leftmost column are for a given
input from the current tape frame. The entries in the state
transition table have 3 symbols. The left symbol indicates
the value to be written onto the current tape frame, the
middle symbol indicates the direction that the tape head
will move, and the right symbol indicates the next state to
enter. The entry that corresponds to the current state and
tape input value is highlighted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The text window
must be tall enough for the state transition table to fit,
in order for it to be displayed. If the window is not tall
enough, then a message is printed indicating the height
needed to display the table. E.g., For a 5-state Turing
Machine, the window should be at least 24 lines tall.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape
display has three parts, verticlly stacked: the tape
indices, the tape values, and the tape head position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape
display shows the tape indices above the tape values. These
indices are not actually used by the Turing Machine, but
they are useful to a human trying to keep track of what the
Turing Machine is doing. The tape index 0 is the starting
point for the tape head.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape values
are printed with spaces between the values. Remember that,
for a true Turing Machine, the tape is infinitely long.
However, in this simulation, the tape&rsquo;s stored length
is finite (although the tape will &quot;grow&quot;
indefinitely, as new portions are accessed) . When the
entire stored tape will not fit on the screen, then ellipsis
are displayed indicating that there is more of the tape than
what is being displayed. Remember that if ellipsis are not
visible, it means that the representation of the tape is not
currently being stored. It does NOT mean that you are
looking at the end of the tape. There is no end of the tape.
The tape is infinite.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape values
will scroll left and right as the tape head moves. The tape
head will also move, when scrolling the tape is not
appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Below the tape
values portion of the tape display is the tape head location
indicator, along with the tape index where the tape head
sits. Again, this index is not used by the abstract Turing
Machine, but it is useful for humans.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape
display assumes that the character set has only 1-digit
values. If the charset_max is greater than 9, then the tape
display will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only positive
integers are allowed for the character set. In theory, any
set of symbols should be allowed, including a set of strings
or funny-looking shapes, like Greek letters or card suites.
However, since any finite set has ennumerable members, then
positive integers will always suffice to simulate a Turing
Machine. In fact, only a very small number of symbols is
needed to simulate ANY Turing Machine (by creating a
Universal Turing Machine). It is just a matter of encoding
the symbols with an appropriate scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tape grows
dynamically so this simulator will eventually run out of
memory if the Turing Machine runs over a large enough
section of tape. If you have access to the source code, it
is a trivial matter to change the primitive type of the
character set, and of the state, so that you could use a
smaller primitive type to conserve memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This simulation
was designed to be easy to understand, not to run fast. This
code would probably not provide a great basis for doing
advanced theory of computation. However, the visual display
makes debugging state transition tables easier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only way to
change the maximum number of iterations is to change the
source code and recompile. It would be simple to add a
command line option to do this instead, which I should
do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The busy beaver
rejection algorithms are simple and err on the side of
safety, in the sense that no valid busy beavers are
rejected, but a lot of unfruitful busy beavers are allowed
to run. There are several semi-obvious rejection schemes
which could be implemented. For example, Turing machine
tables have a kind of symmetry, where more than one machine
performs exactly the same. These symmetries are due to the
fact that the number associated with a state is not germain
(except for state 0 which is the initial state). Also, it
does not matter whether a machine moes to the left or right
-- which gives a two-fold symmetry. These are not currently
considered in the rejection procedures.</p>
